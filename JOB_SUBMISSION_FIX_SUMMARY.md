# Job Submission Error Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The job submission was failing with "Job creation error details: {}" because there was a mismatch between:
1. What the code was trying to insert into the database
2. What the actual database schema supported

## Root Causes
1. **Column name mismatch**: Code was using `estimated_cost` but database column is `estimate_price`
2. **Missing column**: Code was trying to insert `specifications` column which doesn't exist in the actual database
3. **Schema mismatch**: Database types were outdated compared to actual table structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed useJobSubmission.ts Hook
- Changed `estimated_cost` to `estimate_price` to match actual database column
- Removed `specifications` field which doesn't exist in the database
- Added proper customer and service name retrieval for display fields
- Used correct service column name (`title` instead of `name`)
- Set safe default for `job_type` field
- Improved error handling with more specific messages

### 2. Updated Database Types
- Updated `jobs` table schema to match actual database structure
- Fixed column names (`jobNo` instead of `job_number`, `estimate_price` instead of `estimated_cost`)
- Added missing columns that exist in the actual database
- Updated `services` table schema with correct column names
- Defined proper enum values for `job_type`

### 3. Testing
- Created comprehensive tests to verify the fixes work
- Confirmed job creation now works correctly
- Verified all required fields are properly handled
- Tested error handling scenarios

## Verification
All tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ Job creation with correct schema
- ✅ Proper counter function usage
- ✅ Correct column names
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ File attachment simulation

## Files Modified
1. `src/lib/hooks/useJobSubmission.ts` - Main fix for job submission logic
2. `src/lib/database.types.ts` - Updated to match actual database schema

The job submission error should now be resolved, and users should be able to submit jobs successfully.
