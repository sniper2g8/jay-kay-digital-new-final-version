-- CORRECTED Fix for Password Recovery - Respect Supabase Schema
-- The issue is NOT empty strings, but how Supabase handles them in Go backend

-- ====================================================================
-- ANALYSIS: Supabase Auth Schema Requirements
-- ====================================================================

/*
INSIGHT: Supabase auth.users columns are DESIGNED to have empty strings as defaults:
- confirmation_token: "" (not NULL)
- recovery_token: "" (not NULL) 
- email_change_token_new: "" (not NULL)
- phone_change_token: "" (not NULL)
- etc.

THE REAL ISSUE: Supabase's Go API has a bug where it tries to scan these empty strings 
into a struct that expects NULL for empty values.

SOLUTION: We need to work around this by either:
1. Temporarily setting them to NULL during recovery operations
2. Using a different approach for password recovery
3. Checking if this is a known Supabase issue
*/

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 1: Check current state (should show empty strings, not NULL)
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'CURRENT AUTH SCHEMA STATE' as analysis;
SELECT 
  email,
  confirmation_token,
  recovery_token,
  email_change_token_new,
  phone_change_token,
  length(confirmation_token) as confirmation_token_length,
  length(recovery_token) as recovery_token_length
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'admin@jaykaydigitalpress.com';

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 2: Temporary Workaround - Set problematic fields to NULL
-- ====================================================================

-- This is a workaround for the Supabase Go backend scanning issue
-- Note: This may break other Supabase functionality that expects empty strings

UPDATE auth.users 
SET 
  confirmation_token = NULL,
  recovery_token = NULL,
  email_change_token_new = NULL,
  email_change_token_current = NULL,
  phone_change_token = NULL,
  reauthentication_token = NULL
WHERE confirmation_token = '' 
   OR recovery_token = ''
   OR email_change_token_new = ''
   OR email_change_token_current = ''
   OR phone_change_token = ''
   OR reauthentication_token = '';

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 3: Verification
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'AFTER WORKAROUND' as analysis;
SELECT 
  email,
  confirmation_token IS NULL as confirmation_is_null,
  recovery_token IS NULL as recovery_is_null,
  email_change_token_new IS NULL as email_change_is_null,
  phone_change_token IS NULL as phone_change_is_null
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'admin@jaykaydigitalpress.com';

-- ====================================================================
-- ALTERNATIVE: Check Supabase Version and Known Issues
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'SUPABASE VERSION CHECK' as info;
-- This query might help identify if this is a known issue
SELECT version() as postgres_version;

-- ====================================================================
-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'RECOMMENDATIONS' as info;
SELECT 
  '1. This is likely a Supabase backend issue with Go struct scanning' as rec1,
  '2. Setting to NULL is a workaround, not the proper fix' as rec2,
  '3. Monitor Supabase releases for fixes to this issue' as rec3,
  '4. Consider reporting this as a bug to Supabase if not already known' as rec4;

SELECT '⚠️ Workaround applied - Password recovery should work but this may affect other auth features' as warning;
