# RLS Issue Investigation Summary

## Current Status
We're experiencing permission denied errors when accessing core business tables and statement tables, even with the service role which should bypass all RLS policies.

## Test Results
From our comprehensive testing:
1. Service role can access [appUsers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\lib\hooks\useCustomers.ts#L85-L93) but NOT [customers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\app\dashboard\payments\page.tsx#L34-L34) or statement tables
2. Regular users can access [appUsers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\lib\hooks\useCustomers.ts#L85-L93) and [customers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\app\dashboard\payments\page.tsx#L34-L34) but NOT statement tables

## Key Observations
1. The service role should bypass ALL RLS policies, but it's not working for [customers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\app\dashboard\payments\page.tsx#L34-L34) and statement tables
2. This suggests the issue is not with the RLS policy definitions themselves, but with something else
3. Regular users can access [customers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\app\dashboard\payments\page.tsx#L34-L34), which means the RLS policies for [customers](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\app\dashboard\payments\page.tsx#L34-L34) are working correctly for regular users

## Possible Causes
1. **Service role configuration issue** - The service role key might not be correctly configured or might not have the expected permissions
2. **Table ownership issues** - The tables might be owned by a different user that's restricting access
3. **Supabase project configuration** - There might be project-level settings affecting access
4. **Conflicting policies** - Multiple policies might be conflicting with each other

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Service Role Key
- Double-check that the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in your `.env` file is correct
- Verify that it matches the service role key in your Supabase project settings

### 2. Check Table Ownership
- Run the [check-table-ownership.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\check-table-ownership.sql) script in the Supabase SQL editor to verify table ownership

### 3. Simplify RLS Policies
- Temporarily disable RLS on the problematic tables to isolate the issue:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE customers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ALTER TABLE customer_statement_periods DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
  ```
- Test access again with both service role and regular user

### 4. Check Supabase Project Settings
- Verify that there are no project-level restrictions that might be affecting access
- Check if there are any network restrictions or IP whitelisting that might be blocking access

### 5. Contact Supabase Support
- If none of the above steps work, this might be an issue with the Supabase project itself that requires support intervention

## Immediate Actions Needed
1. Run [check-table-ownership.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\check-table-ownership.sql) in the Supabase SQL editor
2. Verify the service role key in your project settings
3. Try temporarily disabling RLS on problematic tables to test access
