# Invoice Items RLS Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The dashboard is unable to load invoice details because it's trying to access the `invoice_items` table, but this table doesn't have proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured. In contrast, the `invoice_line_items` table does have RLS policies.

## Current State Analysis
Based on our diagnostic scripts, we've identified:

1. **Table Structure**: Both `invoice_items` and `invoice_line_items` tables exist
2. **Data Content**: `invoice_items` contains the actual invoice line item data, while `invoice_line_items` may be empty or used for a different purpose
3. **RLS Status**: `invoice_line_items` has RLS policies, but `invoice_items` does not
4. **Relationship**: Both tables should have a foreign key relationship with the `invoices` table through an `invoice_id` column

## Root Cause
The `invoice_items` table is missing RLS policies that would allow:
- Service roles to access all records (for backend operations)
- Authenticated users to access records based on their role or ownership
- Proper access control for different user types (admin, staff, customer)

## Solution
We need to apply RLS policies to the `invoice_items` table that mirror the policies on `invoice_line_items` but are appropriate for the `invoice_items` data structure.

## Recommended Fix Scripts
1. **comprehensive-diagnostic.sql** - Run this first to understand the current state
2. **fix-invoice-items-rls-migration-corrected.sql** - Apply this to add proper RLS policies
3. **verify-fix.sql** - Run this to confirm the fix worked

## Expected Policies
The `invoice_items` table should have policies that allow:
1. Service role full access to all records
2. Admin/staff users to view all records
3. Regular users to view only their own invoice items (based on invoice ownership)

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Verify that the dashboard can load invoice details
2. Confirm that API routes can access invoice items data
3. Ensure that proper access controls are still in place
