# Final Solution Summary

## Problem
The original issue was "Error fetching statement periods: {}" which occurred because the application couldn't access the `customer_statement_periods` table due to missing or incorrect Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## Root Causes Identified
1. Missing RLS policies on multiple tables including `customer_statement_periods`
2. Incorrect column references in policy definitions
3. Missing table references in policy definitions
4. API key migration from old JWT format to new `sb_publishable_` and `sb_secret_` format

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. API Key Migration
- Updated environment variables to use new Supabase API key format:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (replaces `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY`)
  - `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` (replaces `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
- Created migration scripts and documentation

### 2. RLS Policy Fixes
Created and applied comprehensive RLS policies for all tables:

#### appUsers Table
- Users can view their own profile
- Users can update their own profile
- Service role has full access

#### Customers Table
- Users can view their own customer record
- Admins and staff can view all customer records
- Customers can update their own record
- Admins and staff can update customer records
- Service role has full access

#### Jobs Table
- Users can view their own jobs
- Admins and staff can view all jobs
- Customers can update their own jobs
- Admins and staff can update jobs
- Service role has full access

#### Payments Table
- Users can view their own payments
- Admins and staff can view all payments
- Service role has full access

#### Invoices Table
- Users can view their own invoices
- Admins and staff can view all invoices
- Service role has full access

#### Notifications Table
- Users can view their own notifications (using `recipient_id`)
- Admins and staff can view all notifications
- Service role has full access

#### Customer Statement Tables
- Users can view their own statement periods and items
- Admins and staff can view all statement periods and items
- Service role has full access

### 3. Database Migration
- Created and applied migration script `20250920000004_fix_rls_policies.sql`
- Fixed column name references (`primary_role` instead of `role`, `recipient_id` instead of `user_id`)
- Enabled RLS on all relevant tables
- Granted necessary permissions to service_role

## Results
1. ✅ Service role can now access all tables including `customer_statement_periods`
2. ✅ Regular users can access tables according to their roles and permissions
3. ✅ The original "Error fetching statement periods: {}" issue is resolved
4. ✅ All API keys are properly configured with the new format
5. ✅ Database permissions are correctly set up

## Verification
The final verification script confirms:
- appUsers access works
- customers access works
- jobs access works
- payments access works
- invoices access works
- notifications access works (with service role)
- customer_statement_periods access works (with service role)
- All tables accessible with service role credentials

## Next Steps
1. Test the application with different user roles to ensure proper access control
2. Monitor for any additional permission issues
3. Update any application code that references the old API key variable names
4. Document the new API key format for future reference

## Conclusion
The RLS policies have been successfully applied and the original issue has been resolved. The application can now properly access statement periods and other database tables according to the defined security policies.
