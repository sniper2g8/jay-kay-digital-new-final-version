# Current Status of Invoice Items RLS Fix

## What We Know
1. There is an existing function called `fix_invoice_items_rls` in the database
2. There is a migration file [migrations/fix_invoice_items_rls.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\migrations\fix_invoice_items_rls.sql) that attempts to fix RLS policies
3. The `invoice_items` table has an `invoice_id` column that links to the `invoices` table
4. The dashboard is currently unable to load invoice details due to RLS issues

## Issues Identified
1. The existing migration file [migrations/fix_invoice_items_rls.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\migrations\fix_invoice_items_rls.sql) has incorrect policy names (refers to "invoice line items" instead of "invoice items")
2. The existing function `fix_invoice_items_rls` may not be properly implemented or may not have been executed
3. The current RLS policies on `invoice_items` may not be correctly configured

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Run [check-existing-functions.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\check-existing-functions.sql) to see what the existing function does
2. If the function exists and is correct, execute it
3. If the function doesn't exist or is incorrect, run our [final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql) script
4. Verify the fix worked with [verify-invoice-items-fix.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\verify-invoice-items-fix.sql)
5. Test the dashboard invoice view

## Expected Outcome
After properly configuring RLS policies on the `invoice_items` table:
- Users with admin/super_admin/manager/staff roles in appUsers should be able to view all invoice items
- Users who generated an invoice (generated_by = auth.uid()) should be able to view their invoice items
- Users who are customers for an invoice (customer_id = auth.uid()) should be able to view their invoice items
- Service role should have full access for backend operations
- The dashboard should be able to load invoice details without errors
