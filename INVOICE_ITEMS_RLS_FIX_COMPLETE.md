# Invoice Items RLS Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Analysis
The dashboard was unable to load invoice details because the `invoice_items` table was missing proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies. This caused a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to access invoice item data.

## Key Findings
1. **Table Structure**: The `invoice_items` table contains the actual invoice line item data
2. **Linking Column**: The `invoice_items` table has an `invoice_id` column that properly links to the `invoices` table
3. **Missing RLS**: The `invoice_items` table had no RLS policies, unlike `invoice_line_items` which had policies but links to jobs instead of invoices

## Solution Implemented
We created proper RLS policies for the `invoice_items` table that allow:

1. **Regular Users**: Can view invoice items for invoices they generated or own
2. **Admin/Staff Users**: Can view all invoice items
3. **Service Role**: Has full access to all invoice items (for backend operations)

## Fix Script
The solution is implemented in [final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql) which:

1. Enables RLS on the `invoice_items` table
2. Creates three policies:
   - Users can view their own invoice items (based on `invoice_id` linking to `invoices`)
   - Admins and staff can view all invoice items
   - Service role has full access
3. Grants necessary permissions to service_role

## Verification
The fix can be verified using [verify-invoice-items-fix.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\verify-invoice-items-fix.sql) which:
1. Checks that RLS is enabled
2. Verifies that policies were created correctly
3. Tests data access

## Expected Outcome
After applying this fix:
1. The dashboard should be able to load invoice details without errors
2. Users will only see invoice items they're authorized to view
3. Admin and staff users will have appropriate access to all invoice items
4. Backend operations will work correctly with service role access

## Implementation Steps
1. Run [final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\final-fix-invoice-items-rls.sql) in your Supabase SQL editor
2. Run [verify-invoice-items-fix.sql](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\scripts\verify-invoice-items-fix.sql) to confirm the fix worked
3. Test the dashboard invoice view to confirm items display correctly
