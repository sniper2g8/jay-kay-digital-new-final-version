# Payment Processing Fix Summary

## Issue
The "Error processing payment: {}" was occurring in the InvoiceDetailContent component when users tried to record payments.

## Root Cause
1. The handlePayment function was using the browser Supabase client which lacked permissions to insert into the payments table
2. Incorrect data structure being sent to the payments table (using customer_id instead of customer_human_id)
3. Environment variable mismatch in the Supabase client configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Server Actions
Created `src/app/actions/payment-actions.ts` with two server actions:
- `processPayment`: Handles payment insertion using service role client
- `updateInvoiceAfterPayment`: Updates invoice status after payment

### 2. Fixed Environment Variables
Updated `src/lib/supabase.ts` to correctly reference environment variables:
```typescript
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!;
```

### 3. Corrected Data Structure
Updated server actions to use the correct field format:
- `customer_human_id` instead of `customer_id`
- Proper payment number generation
- Correct field mapping for all payment data

### 4. Updated Component
Modified the handlePayment function in `src/app/dashboard/invoices/[id]/page.tsx` to use server actions instead of direct Supabase calls.

## How It Works Now
1. User clicks "Record Payment" 
2. handlePayment function collects payment data
3. Calls processPayment server action
4. Server action uses service role client to insert payment
5. Calls updateInvoiceAfterPayment server action to update invoice
6. UI updates to reflect changes
7. User receives success confirmation

## Benefits
- Proper separation of concerns (client vs server)
- Enhanced security (privileged operations on server)
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Follows Next.js best practices for server actions
- Maintains data integrity with proper foreign key relationships

## Testing
Verified that payments can be successfully recorded with:
- Correct customer_human_id format
- Proper invoice linking
- Appropriate payment status updates
- Accurate amount tracking
