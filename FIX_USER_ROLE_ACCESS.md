# Fix User Role Access Issues

## Problem Analysis

The console error "Error fetching user role: {}" indicates that the [useUserRole](file:///D:/Web Apps/jay-kay-digital-press-new/src/lib/hooks/useUserRole.ts#L60-L80) hook is failing to fetch user role data. After investigation, we identified several potential causes:

1. **Timing Issues**: The hook may be called before the authentication session is fully initialized
2. **RLS Policy Configuration**: Although we've fixed the recursion issue, there might still be access problems
3. **Error Handling**: The error object is not being properly logged, making debugging difficult

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging in useUserRole Hook

We've updated the [useUserRole](file:///D:/Web Apps/jay-kay-digital-press-new/src/lib/hooks/useUserRole.ts#L60-L80) hook to provide more detailed error logging:

- Added comprehensive error logging with structured data
- Added session validation checks
- Added timing delays to ensure session initialization
- Added better debugging information

### 2. Verified RLS Policy Configuration

We confirmed that the RLS policies on the appUsers table are correctly configured:

```
Policy: service_role_bypass_appusers
  Table: appUsers
  Roles: {service_role}
  Command: ALL
  Qual: true
  With Check: true

Policy: users_read_own_record
  Table: appUsers
  Roles: {authenticated}
  Command: SELECT
  Qual: (id = auth.uid())
  With Check: NULL

Policy: users_update_own_record
  Table: appUsers
  Roles: {authenticated}
  Command: UPDATE
  Qual: (id = auth.uid())
  With Check: (id = auth.uid())
```

### 3. Testing Scripts

We've created several test scripts to verify the fixes:

1. `test-user-role-access.cjs` - Tests user role access policies
2. `debug-user-role-access.cjs` - Debugs user role access in detail
3. `test-user-role-fetching.cjs` - Tests user role fetching functionality

## Verification Steps

1. Run the test scripts to verify user role access:
   ```bash
   node test-user-role-access.cjs
   node debug-user-role-access.cjs
   ```

2. Test the user role fetching in the browser by navigating to `/test-user-role`

3. Check the browser console for detailed logging from the enhanced [useUserRole](file:///D:/Web Apps/jay-kay-digital-press-new/src/lib/hooks/useUserRole.ts#L60-L80) hook

## Expected Results

- The console error "Error fetching user role: {}" should no longer appear
- User role data should be successfully fetched for authenticated users
- Proper error messages should be displayed when issues occur
- The notification system should work correctly with proper user role access
