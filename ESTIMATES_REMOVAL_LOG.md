# Estimates Feature Removal Log

## Date: September 17, 2025

## Summary
Removed the estimates functionality from the application as requested. This feature can be added back as a future upgrade when needed.

## Files Removed
1. **Estimates Pages Directory**: `src/app/dashboard/estimates/`
   - `page.tsx` - Main estimates listing page
   - `create/page.tsx` - Create estimate page
   - Any other estimate-related pages

2. **Estimates Hook**: `src/lib/hooks/useEstimates.ts`
   - React hook for managing estimates data
   - Contains interfaces and API calls for estimates

## Files NOT Removed (Kept for Reference)
- `migrations/create_estimates_table.js` - Database migration script (kept for historical reference)

## TypeScript Errors Resolved
✅ All TypeScript errors related to `customer_estimates` table access
✅ All missing property errors (`title`, `status`, `estimate_number`, etc.)
✅ All `useEstimates` import errors

## Navigation
- No estimates navigation items were found in `RoleBasedNav.tsx` (already clean)
- No dashboard links to estimates pages found

## Database State
- The `customer_estimates` table was never created in the database
- All existing functionality continues to work with the jobs table
- Invoice system remains fully functional

## Future Implementation Notes
When estimates are re-implemented in the future:
1. Run the `migrations/create_estimates_table.js` to create the database table
2. Recreate the estimates pages and hooks
3. Add estimates navigation to `RoleBasedNav.tsx`
4. Update database types to include the estimates table
5. Implement proper RLS policies for estimates

## Current System Status
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation clean
✅ Development server running on port 3003
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Invoice system fully operational
