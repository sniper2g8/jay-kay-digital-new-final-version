# Fix for React Hydration Error in NotificationManager Component

## Problem
The NotificationManager component was causing a React hydration error:
```
Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client.
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Client/Server Rendering Mismatch**: The component was rendering differently on the server vs. client due to client-side state initialization
2. **Invalid Environment Variable**: The `.env.local` file contained an invalid export statement: `export DENO_UNSTABLE_BARE_NODE_BUILTINS=true`

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed NotificationManager Component (`src/components/NotificationManager.tsx`)

Added proper client-side rendering pattern to ensure consistent rendering:

```typescript
// Added client detection pattern
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);

// Render nothing on server, only on client
if (!isClient) {
  return <div className={`space-y-6 ${className}`}></div>;
}
```

This ensures:
- The component renders an empty div on the server
- The full component renders only on the client after hydration
- Eliminates mismatches between server and client rendering

### 2. Fixed Environment Files (`.env` and `.env.local`)

Removed the invalid export statement:
```diff
- export DENO_UNSTABLE_BARE_NODE_BUILTINS=true
+ DENO_UNSTABLE_BARE_NODE_BUILTINS=true
```

Environment files should contain only key-value pairs, not shell export statements.

## Verification

The fixes have been verified with the test script `test-hydration-fix.mjs`:
- ✅ Component properly configured for client-side rendering
- ✅ Environment files do not contain problematic export statements

## Next Steps

1. Restart your Next.js development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the notification test page to verify the fix

## Prevention

To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always use the client detection pattern for components that rely on client-side state
2. Validate environment files to ensure they contain only key-value pairs
3. Test components in both server and client contexts
