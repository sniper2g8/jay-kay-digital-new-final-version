# Jay Kay Digital Press - Deployment Guide

## Current Status

✅ **Production Ready Application**

- Authentication system fully functional
- Database integration complete with Supabase
- All core features implemented:
  - Customer management
  - Job submission workflow
  - Financial tracking (invoices & payments)
  - Dashboard with real-time statistics
  - Paper specifications system
- Live data integration (no mock data)
- Responsive UI with shadcn/ui components

## Database Setup Required

### 1. Fix Database Permissions

Run the following SQL scripts in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **fix-rls-policies.sql** - Fixes Row Level Security policies for all tables
2. **populate_finish_options.sql** - Populates finishing options data

**Instructions:**

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste each SQL file content
5. Click "Run" to execute each migration

### 2. Populate Paper Specifications (Optional but Recommended)

The paper specifications tables exist but are empty. Run the migration script:

```bash
node migrations/run_paper_specifications.js
```

Or manually execute the SQL in `migrations/create_paper_specifications.sql`

## Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

## Available Scripts

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Fix authentication tokens (if needed)
npm run fix:auth-tokens

# Check database permissions
npm run fix:db-permissions
```

## Testing the Application

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
