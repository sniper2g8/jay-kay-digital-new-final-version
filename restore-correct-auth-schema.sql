-- CORRECT APPROACH: Verify and Fix Supabase Auth Schema Compliance
-- Based on the official Supabase auth.users schema pattern

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 1: Check current schema compliance
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'SCHEMA COMPLIANCE CHECK' as step;

-- Check all users and their token field types
SELECT 
  email,
  CASE 
    WHEN confirmation_token = '' THEN '✅ CORRECT (empty string)'
    WHEN confirmation_token IS NULL THEN '❌ WRONG (should be empty string)'
    ELSE '⚠️ HAS VALUE'
  END as confirmation_token_status,
  CASE 
    WHEN recovery_token = '' THEN '✅ CORRECT (empty string)'
    WHEN recovery_token IS NULL THEN '❌ WRONG (should be empty string)'
    ELSE '⚠️ HAS VALUE'
  END as recovery_token_status,
  CASE 
    WHEN email_change_token_new = '' THEN '✅ CORRECT (empty string)'
    WHEN email_change_token_new IS NULL THEN '❌ WRONG (should be empty string)'
    ELSE '⚠️ HAS VALUE'
  END as email_change_token_status
FROM auth.users 
ORDER BY email;

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 2: Fix any NULL values that should be empty strings
-- ====================================================================

-- Restore proper Supabase schema compliance
-- Set NULL token fields back to empty strings as per official schema

UPDATE auth.users 
SET confirmation_token = '' 
WHERE confirmation_token IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET recovery_token = '' 
WHERE recovery_token IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_change_token_new = '' 
WHERE email_change_token_new IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET email_change_token_current = '' 
WHERE email_change_token_current IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET phone_change = '' 
WHERE phone_change IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET phone_change_token = '' 
WHERE phone_change_token IS NULL;

UPDATE auth.users 
SET reauthentication_token = '' 
WHERE reauthentication_token IS NULL;

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 3: Verify schema compliance is restored
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'SCHEMA COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION' as step;

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN confirmation_token = '' THEN 1 END) as correct_confirmation_tokens,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN recovery_token = '' THEN 1 END) as correct_recovery_tokens,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN email_change_token_new = '' THEN 1 END) as correct_email_change_tokens,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN confirmation_token IS NULL THEN 1 END) as wrong_null_confirmation_tokens,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN recovery_token IS NULL THEN 1 END) as wrong_null_recovery_tokens
FROM auth.users;

-- ====================================================================
-- STEP 4: Sample user verification against official schema
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'SAMPLE USER SCHEMA VERIFICATION' as step;

SELECT 
  email,
  confirmation_token,
  recovery_token,
  email_change_token_new,
  email_change_token_current,
  phone_change,
  phone_change_token,
  reauthentication_token,
  -- Verify these match the expected pattern
  confirmation_token = '' as confirmation_matches_schema,
  recovery_token = '' as recovery_matches_schema,
  email_change_token_new = '' as email_change_matches_schema
FROM auth.users 
WHERE email = 'admin@jaykaydigitalpress.com';

-- ====================================================================
-- CONCLUSION
-- ====================================================================

SELECT 'ANALYSIS RESULT' as conclusion;
SELECT 
  'If all token fields are now empty strings and password recovery still fails,' as issue1,
  'then this is a genuine Supabase backend bug with Go struct scanning.' as issue2,
  'The schema is now correctly compliant with official Supabase auth.users structure.' as resolution;

SELECT 'Schema restored to Supabase compliance - test password recovery' as result;
