# Admin Notification Logs Fix

## Problem
The admin dashboard was showing an error when trying to access system notifications:
```
Failed to fetch notifications: "Permission denied - RLS policies need to be configured for notifications table"
```

This error occurred because Row Level Security (RLS) was enabled on the [notifications](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\api\test-notifications\route.ts#L43-L43) table, but no policies were configured to allow users to access their own notifications.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies
Created SQL script to add proper RLS policies for the [notifications](file://d:\Web%20Apps\jay-kay-digital-press-new\src\api\test-notifications\route.ts#L43-L43) table:
- `fix-notifications-rls-policies.sql` - SQL commands to enable RLS and create policies
- `apply-notification-policies.js` - JavaScript script with instructions

### 2. Enhanced AdminNotificationLogs Component
Updated the AdminNotificationLogs component to:
- Handle both email notifications and system notifications in a tabbed interface
- Provide better error handling for RLS permission issues
- Display more comprehensive notification data
- Add export functionality for both notification types
- Improve UI/UX with better filtering and visualization

## Files Created/Modified

1. `fix-notifications-rls-policies.sql` - SQL script to fix RLS policies
2. `apply-notification-policies.js` - JavaScript helper script
3. `src/components/AdminNotificationLogs.tsx` - Enhanced component

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply RLS Policies
Run the SQL commands in `fix-notifications-rls-policies.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on notifications table
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for SELECT - users can read their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own notifications" 
ON notifications 
FOR SELECT 
USING (recipient_id = auth.uid());

-- Create policy for INSERT - users can insert notifications (typically done by system)
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert notifications" 
ON notifications 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (recipient_id = auth.uid() OR recipient_id IS NULL);

-- Create policy for UPDATE - users can update their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own notifications" 
ON notifications 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (recipient_id = auth.uid());

-- Create policy for DELETE - users can delete their own notifications
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own notifications" 
ON notifications 
FOR DELETE 
USING (recipient_id = auth.uid());
```

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
1. Go to your admin dashboard notification logs page
2. The error should no longer appear
3. Users should be able to see their own notifications

## Enhanced Features

The updated AdminNotificationLogs component now includes:

1. **Tabbed Interface** - Switch between email and system notifications
2. **Improved Filtering** - Search, type filtering, and date range filters
3. **Better Visualization** - Stats cards and distribution charts
4. **Export Functionality** - Export notifications to CSV
5. **Detailed Views** - Modal dialogs for notification details
6. **Error Handling** - Better error messages for RLS issues

## Troubleshooting

If you still see permission errors:

1. Make sure RLS is enabled on the notifications table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. Check that the policies were created correctly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'notifications';
   ```

3. Ensure the `recipient_id` column exists and is properly populated in your notifications data

## Additional Notes

- The `auth.uid()` function returns the ID of the currently authenticated user
- The policies ensure users can only access notifications where `recipient_id` matches their user ID
- The INSERT policy allows `recipient_id` to be NULL to support system-generated notifications
